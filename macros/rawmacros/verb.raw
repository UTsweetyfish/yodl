macro(verb(text))
 (Sets tt(text) in verbatim mode: not subject to macro expansion or character
table expansion, and starting with Yodl version 4.00.00: not using tt(SUBST)
definitions. See also tt(verborg), which does not provide the protection
against tt(SUBST) definitions.

While converting Yodl-documents to target document types Yodl frequently uses
the (not further documented) builtin function tt(CHAR(X)XSUBST). In the
unlikely event that the text tt(XXSUBST+CHAR(40)...CHAR(41)) must be written
in a document, the sequence
    verb(
    XXSUBST++CHAR(C)HAR(40)...CHAR(C)HAR(41)
    )
    can be used.

 The text that is passed as argument to the tt(verb)-macro appears literally
on the output, usually in a teletype font (that depends on the output
format). This macro is for larger chunks, e.g., listings. 

 When starting the tt(verb+CHAR(40)) macro on a line by itself and writing the
closing parenthesis on a line by itself then those newlines also appear in the
resulting verbatim text. To omit those lines immediately start the first line
of text after tt(verb) and append the closing parenthesis to the last line of
verbatim text. E.g.,
    verb(verb(    First line of indented literal text
    Last line of indented literal text))

 When unbalanced parameter lists are required, use tt(CHAR(C)HAR(40)) to get
tt(CHAR(40)) and tt(CHAR(C)HAR(41)) to get tt(CHAR(41)).)
